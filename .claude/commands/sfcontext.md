# Salesforce Project Context Loader

Read the file `docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` and perform the following:

## 1. Status Overview
Provide a concise summary of:
- Current project phase and overall status
- What's complete vs in-progress
- Current branch information

## 2. Pending Work by Owner
List pending tasks grouped by:
- **Claude Code tasks** (what I should work on)
- **Cursor tasks** (parallel work)
- **Human tasks** (requires manual action)

## 3. Populate Todo List
Use the TodoWrite tool to add the pending Claude Code tasks to the todo list so progress can be tracked in this session.

## 4. Recommended Next Action
Based on the pending tasks, recommend what to work on first and ask if the user wants to proceed.

## 5. Update Context (End of Session)
Remind me to update `docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` before ending the session if any tasks were completed.
