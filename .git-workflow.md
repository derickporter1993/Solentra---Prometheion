# Git Workflow for Prometheion

## Standard Workflow After Task Completion

After any work is created or a set of tasks are complete, always follow this sequence:

### 1. Commit Changes Locally
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

### 2. Push to Remote Feature Branch
```bash
git push origin <feature-branch>
```

### 3. Merge to Main and Push
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Ensure main is up to date
git merge <feature-branch> --no-ff -m "Merge feature branch: <description>"
git push origin main
git checkout <feature-branch>  # Return to feature branch
```

## Current Feature Branch
- **Branch Name**: `claude/review-prometheion-app-0BLu9`

## Quick Reference Commands

### Full Workflow (replace <feature-branch> with actual branch name):
```bash
# Get current branch name
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin $BRANCH

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge $BRANCH --no-ff -m "Merge feature branch: Your description"
git push origin main

# Return to feature branch
git checkout $BRANCH
```

## Notes
- Always use `--no-ff` for merge commits to preserve branch history
- Always pull main before merging to avoid conflicts
- Return to feature branch after merging to continue work
