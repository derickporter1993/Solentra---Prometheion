## What is Elaro?

Elaro is a **2GP managed package** for the Salesforce AppExchange that turns your org into a continuously monitored, audit-ready compliance platform. It automates the work that compliance teams spend weeks doing manually — detecting configuration drift, scoring risk across regulatory frameworks, collecting audit evidence, and remediating violations.

Elaro covers **14 compliance frameworks** out of the box, with dedicated service classes, automated scanners, and framework-specific scoring for each one. It doesn't just detect problems — it explains _why_ they matter, suggests fixes, and can auto-remediate common violations with a single click.

---

## Who It's For

Elaro is built for **regulated organizations running Salesforce**:

- **Healthcare** — HIPAA Privacy/Security Rules, PHI protection, breach notification tracking
- **Financial Services** — SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GLBA, FINRA, SEC Cybersecurity, SOX compliance
- **Government & Defense** — FedRAMP, CMMC 2.0, NIST controls
- **EU-Regulated Organizations** — GDPR, NIS2, DORA, EU AI Act
- **Any Regulated Org** — ISO 27001, CCPA, AI Governance (NIST AI RMF)

If you're spending weeks preparing for audits, manually reviewing permissions, or can't explain recent configuration changes — Elaro is for you.

## Features

### Compliance Scoring Engine

Multi-framework compliance scoring with weighted risk factors across every supported framework. Scores update in real-time as your org configuration changes.

| Factor               | Weight | What It Measures                                        |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Permission Sprawl    | 30%    | Users with elevated access (ModifyAllData, ViewAllData) |
| Audit Trail Coverage | 25%    | Objects with Field History Tracking enabled             |
| Configuration Drift  | 20%    | Unreviewed high-risk changes in the last 30 days        |
| Encryption Status    | 15%    | Shield Platform Encryption on PHI/PII fields            |
| Policy Compliance    | 10%    | OWD settings, session timeout, password policy          |

Each framework applies additional framework-specific scoring: HIPAA weighs PHI field exposure, PCI-DSS penalizes unencrypted cardholder data (+4.0 risk), GDPR focuses on personal data protection, and so on.

### Configuration Drift Detection

Real-time monitoring of Salesforce metadata changes via Platform Events and scheduled Setup Audit Trail polling:

- Profile and Permission Set modifications
- Sharing Rule and OWD changes
- Object and Field-Level Security updates
- Flow, Apex, and automation deployments
- Connected App and integration changes
- Session and security setting modifications

High-risk changes trigger multi-channel alerts with AI-generated risk analysis explaining the compliance impact.

### AI-Powered Compliance Intelligence

- **Compliance Copilot** — Natural language interface for compliance queries ("Why did my score drop?", "Show me all risky flows touching PII"). Backed by Claude API integration via Named Credential
- **Change Advisor** — Analyzes proposed changes _before_ they happen and returns score deltas with safer alternatives
- **Risk Predictor** — Einstein-based risk prediction for compliance violations
- **Root Cause Analysis** — AI-powered event chain analysis to identify root causes of compliance events within 24-hour windows
- **Natural Language Query** — Converts plain English to secure SOQL against whitelisted compliance objects
- **Reasoning Engine** — Compliance adjudication using Big Object graph data with deterministic hashing for audit integrity

### Automated Remediation

- **Quick Actions** — One-click fixes for the most common compliance violations
- **Remediation Suggestions** — AI-assisted remediation with confidence scoring and auto-remediation payloads
- **Remediation Orchestrator** — Executes actions: revoke permissions, lock users, notify managers, create cases, quarantine data, force logout, disable API access
- **Rollback Support** — Failed remediations can be rolled back with full audit trail

### Audit Evidence Collection & Export

## Architecture

### Package Structure

Elaro ships as **two separate 2GP managed packages**:

| Package            | Namespace | Path                     | Description                         |

| Elaro              | (shared)  | `force-app/`             | Main compliance platform            |
| Elaro Health Check | elaroHC   | `force-app-healthcheck/` | Standalone security posture scanner |

### Health Check Package

A standalone AppExchange package that scans an org's security posture across five dimensions:

| Scanner               | Weight | What It Scans                                          |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Security Health Check | 40%    | Native Salesforce SecurityHealthCheck via Tooling API  |
| MFA Compliance        | 20%    | LoginHistory MFA adoption percentage                   |

### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions runs on push to `main`, `develop`, `release/*`, `claude/*`:

1. **code-quality** — Format check, linting, security audit
2. **unit-tests** — LWC Jest tests
3. **security-scan** — Salesforce Code Analyzer with AppExchange selectors
4. **validate-metadata** — Directory structure validation
5. **cli-build** — Platform TypeScript build
6. **build-success** — Final deployment readiness check

### Quality Gates

- Code Analyzer v5: Zero HIGH severity findings
- Jest tests: All passing
- Apex tests: 85%+ coverage per class
- WCAG 2.1 AA: Screen reader and keyboard navigation verified

## FAQ

**Does Elaro require Shield Platform Encryption?**
No, but Elaro flags missing encryption as a compliance risk. Shield is strongly recommended for HIPAA and PCI-DSS.

**Does Elaro store data outside Salesforce?**
No. All data stays in your Salesforce org. External integrations (Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, Teams, ServiceNow, Claude API) only send alerts or receive webhooks — no compliance data is stored externally.

**Can I use Elaro in a sandbox?**
Yes. Elaro works in Production, Sandbox, Scratch Orgs, and Developer Edition orgs.

**Can I customize compliance scoring?**
Yes. Compliance controls, policies, and actions are driven by Custom Metadata (`Compliance_Control__mdt`, `Compliance_Policy__mdt`, `Compliance_Action__mdt`), which you can configure per org.

**What about the Health Check package?**
Health Check is a separate 2GP managed package (`elaroHC` namespace) that can be installed independently for organizations that only need security posture scanning without full compliance automation.
