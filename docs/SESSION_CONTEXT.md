## P1 Blockers Detail

### ✅ Input Validation (COMPLETE)
- ~~`PrometheionGraphIndexer.cls`~~ - lines 5-18
- ~~`PerformanceAlertPublisher.cls`~~ - lines 22-31
- ~~`FlowExecutionLogger.cls`~~ - lines 13-19

### ✅ USER_MODE Enforcement (COMPLETE)
- ~~`PrometheionComplianceScorer.cls`~~ - WITH USER_MODE at lines 170, 181, 189, 257, 270, 311, 475
- ~~`PrometheionGraphIndexer.cls`~~ - WITH USER_MODE at lines 79, 100

### ⏳ Trigger Recursion Guards (3 items) - REMAINING
- `PerformanceAlertEventTrigger.trigger` - needs TriggerRecursionGuard
- `PrometheionPCIAccessAlertTrigger.trigger` - needs TriggerRecursionGuard
- `PrometheionEventCaptureTrigger.trigger` - needs TriggerRecursionGuard

### ⏳ Bulk Tests (4 items) - REMAINING
- `PrometheionComplianceScorerTest.cls`
- `PrometheionGraphIndexerTest.cls`
- `EvidenceCollectionServiceTest.cls`
- `PerformanceAlertPublisherTest.cls`

## Key Documents

- `docs/TASK_AUDITOR.md` - Cross-session task tracking
- `docs/plans/V1.5_AI_ASSISTED_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` - Full v1.5 architecture
- `docs/TECHNICAL_IMPROVEMENTS_TRACKER.md` - 57 tracked items
- `docs/IMPROVEMENT_TODOS.md` - 47 actionable items
- `ROADMAP.md` - Product vision v1.0 → v4.0+

## Next Step

**Option 1 (Quick Win)**: Add recursion guards to 3 triggers (~1 hour)
- Removes all remaining P1 security blockers

**Option 2 (Feature Work)**: Start Jira Integration (v1.5 Weeks 2-3)
- External ticket integration for compliance gaps

**Option 3 (Coverage Push)**: Expand bulk tests to 200+ records
- Move toward 75% AppExchange requirement
