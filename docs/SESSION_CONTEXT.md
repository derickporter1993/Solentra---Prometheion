## Key Documents

- `docs/TASK_AUDITOR.md` - Cross-session task tracking
- `docs/plans/V1.5_AI_ASSISTED_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` - Full v1.5 architecture
- `docs/TECHNICAL_IMPROVEMENTS_TRACKER.md` - 57 tracked items
- `docs/IMPROVEMENT_TODOS.md` - 47 actionable items

## Next Step

**Option 1 (P1 Completion)**: Complete framework validation
- Add `PrometheionConstants.isValidFramework()` to remaining service classes
- Last P1 blocker for AppExchange

**Option 2 (Merge Outstanding Work)**: Merge feature branches
- `claude/fix-branch-protection-ci-FqH9b` (21 commits - CI fixes)
- `cursor/add-test-classes-for-7-classes` (21 commits - test classes)
- `claude/add-cli-build-job-ONM5C` (6 commits - CLI build)

**Option 3 (Coverage Push)**: Increase test coverage to 75%
- Current: 48% | Required: 75% for AppExchange
- ~30-40 classes need additional coverage

**Option 4 (P2 Work)**: Start error handling improvements
- Add correlation IDs to 4 core classes
- Improve audit logging
