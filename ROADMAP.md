# Prometheion Product Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-25

This roadmap outlines Prometheion's evolution from a compliance drift detector to a comprehensive Salesforce governance platform.

---

## Product Vision

**Make every Salesforce org audit-ready by default** — no matter the size, industry, or compliance requirements.

Prometheion starts as a **compliance drift guardrail** for regulated organizations, then expands to automated remediation, multi-org governance, and policy-as-code enforcement.

---

## Release Strategy

- **v1.x**: Compliance Drift Baseline (focus on detection & evidence)
- **v2.x**: Multi-Org Governance (scale to enterprise)
- **v3.x**: Automated Remediation (shift from detect to prevent)
- **v4.x+**: Policy-as-Code & AppExchange (platform maturity)

---

## ✅ v1.0 — Compliance Drift Baseline (CURRENT)

**Released**: 2025-12-25
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Goals
- Provide a simple, opinionated compliance baseline for Salesforce orgs
- Detect configuration drift without requiring complex setup
- Generate audit evidence that regulators actually want to see

### Features Delivered
- [x] **Compliance Baseline Scan**: Generates Audit Readiness Score (0-100)
- [x] **Configuration Drift Detection**: Real-time tracking of setup changes
- [x] **Audit Evidence Export**: Markdown/CSV/JSON exports for compliance teams
- [x] **Slack Alerting**: Push notifications for high-risk changes
- [x] **LWC Dashboards**: Governor limits, API usage, Flow execution monitoring
- [x] **Permission Set Analysis**: Identify users with "Modify All" permissions
- [x] **Sharing Rules Audit**: Detect over-permissioned objects

### Metrics
- Test Coverage: **95%+**
- Installation Time: **<10 minutes**
- First Scan Time: **<60 seconds**

### User Feedback Themes (Expected)
- ❓ "Can I customize the Audit Readiness Score?" → v2.0

## 🚧 v1.5 — AI-Assisted Remediation

**Planned Release**: Q2 2025 (April-June)
**Status**: 🚧 In Planning

### Goals
- Reduce time-to-remediation from hours to minutes
- Use AI to explain complex compliance violations
- Automate evidence collection for recurring audits

### Planned Features

#### 1. **AI Change Explanations** 🤖
**Problem**: Users don't understand WHY a change is flagged as high-risk.
**Solution**: GPT/Claude integration to explain compliance violations in plain English.

**Example**:
```
🔴 High-Risk Change Detected

Change: Permission Set "Financial_Data_Access" modified
Risk Score: 8.7/10

AI Explanation:
This change grants 45 users "Modify All Data" permission, which violates
the principle of least privilege (NIST 800-53 AC-6). These users can now
access, modify, or delete ANY data in the org, including PHI/PII.

Compliance Impact:
- HIPAA: Fails "minimum necessary" access requirement (§164.514(d))
- SOC 2: Fails logical access controls (CC6.1)
- SOX: Fails segregation of duties (Section 404)

Suggested Fix:
Create a custom permission set with granular access to only:
- Financial_Transactions__c (Read/Edit)
- Account.AnnualRevenue (Read)
Instead of org-wide "Modify All Data".
```

**Implementation**:
- Integrate with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Use Named Credentials for secure API key storage
- Cache AI responses to reduce API costs
- Fallback to rule-based explanations if AI unavailable

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks

---

#### 2. **Suggested Fixes** 🛠️
**Problem**: Users know WHAT'S wrong, but not HOW to fix it.
**Solution**: Auto-generate remediation steps with copy-paste Apex/metadata.

**Example**:
```
Suggested Fix for: "127 users with Modify All Data"

Step 1: Create Custom Permission Set
Run this Apex to create a granular permission set:

PermissionSet ps = new PermissionSet(
    Name = 'Financial_Data_Limited',
    Label = 'Financial Data (Limited Access)'
);
insert ps;

// Grant specific object permissions
ObjectPermissions op = new ObjectPermissions(
    ParentId = ps.Id,
    SObjectType = 'Financial_Transactions__c',
    PermissionsRead = true,
    PermissionsEdit = true,
    PermissionsCreate = false,
    PermissionsDelete = false
);
insert op;

Step 2: Reassign Users
Export users with "Modify All Data":
Reports → New Report → Users → Filter: PermissionsModifyAllData = true

Step 3: Remove "Modify All Data"
For each user, remove from "Modify All Data" profile/permission set and
assign new "Financial_Data_Limited" permission set.

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours (depending on # of users)
Compliance Impact: Reduces risk score by 20 points
```

**Implementation**:
- Template library for common fixes
- Dynamic code generation based on org metadata
- Validation before suggesting changes
- Rollback scripts included

**Estimated Effort**: 4 weeks

---

#### 3. **Jira Integration** 🎫
**Problem**: Compliance teams work in Jira, but Prometheion alerts live in Salesforce/Slack.
**Solution**: Auto-create Jira tickets for high-risk changes, with bidirectional sync.

**Features**:
- Create Jira ticket when drift event detected
- Attach compliance evidence (audit logs, metadata exports)
- Update Prometheion when Jira ticket is resolved
- Link Prometheion dashboard to Jira issues

**Configuration**:
```apex
// Jira Named Credential setup
Prometheion_Settings__c settings = Prometheion_Settings__c.getInstance();
settings.Jira_Integration_Enabled__c = true;
settings.Jira_Project_Key__c = 'COMPLIANCE';
settings.Jira_Issue_Type__c = 'Compliance Violation';
upsert settings;
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

---

#### 4. **Compliance Report Scheduler** 📧
**Problem**: Compliance teams want weekly/monthly reports, not on-demand scans.
**Solution**: Scheduled jobs that email compliance reports to stakeholders.

**Features**:
- Schedule daily/weekly/monthly scans
- Email report as PDF attachment
- Configurable recipients (compliance team, CISO, auditors)
- Trend charts showing improvement over time

**Configuration**:
```apex
// Schedule weekly report every Monday at 8 AM
System.schedule(
    'Prometheion_Weekly_Report',
    '0 0 8 ? * MON *',
    new ComplianceReportScheduler('weekly', 'compliance@acme.org')
);
```

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

---

#### 5. **Mobile Alerts** 📱
**Problem**: Critical drift events happen outside business hours.
**Solution**: Push notifications to Salesforce Mobile App for on-call teams.

**Features**:
- Push notifications for Critical/High-risk changes
- Deep links to Prometheion dashboard
- Snooze/acknowledge alerts
- Escalation if not acknowledged in 30 minutes

**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

---

### Success Metrics (v1.5)
- **Time-to-Remediation**: <1 hour (down from 4+ hours)
- **AI Explanation Accuracy**: >90% user satisfaction
- **Jira Adoption**: >50% of customers enable integration
- **Alert Response Time**: <15 minutes for critical events

    Enabled__c = true
);
insert siemConfig;
```

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks

---

#### 5. **Custom Compliance Frameworks** 📋

## 🌟 v3.0+ — Automated Remediation

**Planned Release**: 2026+
**Status**: 🌟 Future Vision

### Goals
- Shift from "detect" to "prevent" — stop compliance violations before they happen
- Automate remediation of common drift issues
- Enforce compliance policies via CI/CD

### Planned Features

#### 1. **Auto-Remediation** ⚡
**Problem**: Detecting drift is great, but fixing it manually is tedious.
**Solution**: Automatically fix common compliance violations.

**Example Auto-Remediations**:
- Remove stale permission set assignments (user inactive >90 days)
- Reset OWD to "Private" if changed to "Public Read/Write" without approval
- Revoke "Modify All Data" for non-admin users
- Re-enable Field History Tracking if disabled on compliance-sensitive object

**Safety**:
- Dry-run mode (preview changes before applying)
- Rollback capability (undo last 10 auto-remediations)
- Require approval for high-risk fixes
- Audit trail of all auto-remediations

**Estimated Effort**: 10 weeks

---

#### 2. **Change Control Workflows** 🚦
**Problem**: High-risk changes should require approval, not just alerting.
**Solution**: Approval workflows for setup changes (like pull request reviews).

**Features**:
- Require approval before deploying permission set changes
- Approval matrix (junior admin → senior admin → CISO)
- Integration with existing approval tools (Jira, ServiceNow)
- Auto-reject changes that violate policy

**Example**:
```
Change Request #1234

Requested By: j.smith@acme.org
Change: Add "Modify All Data" to Financial_Data_Access permission set
Risk Level: 🔴 Critical
Compliance Impact: Violates SOX segregation of duties

Status: ⏳ Pending Approval
Approvers:
- Jane Doe (Senior Admin): ⏳ Pending
- John Smith (CISO): ⏳ Pending

Comments:
- j.smith: "Need this to debug production issue"
- Prometheion AI: "This change affects 45 users and increases risk score by 15 points"
```

**Estimated Effort**: 12 weeks

---

#### 3. **Policy-as-Code** 📜
**Problem**: Compliance policies are documented in Word docs, not enforced.
**Solution**: Define compliance policies in YAML, enforce via CI/CD.

**Example Policy**:
```yaml
# acme-healthcare-compliance-policy.yml

policy_name: "Acme Healthcare HIPAA Compliance Policy"
version: "1.2"
effective_date: "2025-12-25"

rules:
  - id: "AC-01"
    name: "Minimum Necessary Access"
    description: "No user should have Modify All Data permission"
    severity: critical
    check:
      - user_permissions.contains("Modify All Data")
    action: block_deployment
    remediation: "Remove Modify All Data, assign granular permission sets"

  - id: "AC-02"
    name: "Audit Trail Coverage"
    description: "Field History must be enabled on all PHI objects"
    severity: high
    check:
      - object.contains_phi == true
      - field_history_tracking.enabled == false
    action: flag_violation
    remediation: "Enable Field History Tracking on {object_name}"

enforcement:
  - block_deployments: true
  - require_approval_on_violation: true
  - auto_remediate_if_possible: false
```

**CI/CD Integration**:
```bash
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Sentinel Policy Check
  run: |
    sf prometheion policy validate \
      --policy acme-healthcare-compliance-policy.yml \
      --target-org production \
      --fail-on-violation
```

**Estimated Effort**: 14 weeks

---

#### 4. **AppExchange Listing** 🏪

**Solution**: Publish Prometheion as a managed package on AppExchange.

**Features**:
- One-click installation from AppExchange
- Managed package (no code visibility, automatic updates)
- Free tier (limited to 1 org, 1 scan/day)
- Paid tiers (multi-org, unlimited scans, premium support)

**Pricing** (proposed):
